#### Intro

I am a co-founder and the CTO of [Arthena](https://arthena.com) where I work on engineering infrastructure and build tools to price fine art. My primary job functions are as a data scientist and software engineer.
<br>
I am available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interested in social impact, education, inclusivity, and space. I enjoy advising companies and may even be available for pro-bono work depending on the time commitment and the project. If you would like to arrange a meeting, I am based in New York but travel to the San Francisco Bay Area frequently.
<br><br>

#### Currently

At Arthena I have learned how to build teams and manage people, build relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models for production environments. I've also learned how to build and maintain large web applications (see [arthena.com](https://arthena.com)).
